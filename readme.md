# Notes
- These are my solutions to the some of the advent of code challenges found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/). 
- Each day consists of two problems. The first problem is usually solved in a file called 'dX.js' and the second using 'dX_V2.js' (where 1<=X<=25). The input will be stored as 'dXX.in' or 'dXX.txt' and sample inputs given by AoC are called 'exX.txt' 
- My goal with these challenges is to attempt to solve as many days that I can
